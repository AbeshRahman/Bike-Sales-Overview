# Bike-Sales-Overview-Dashboard

**Project Overview**: 
The Bike Sales Performance Dashboard is a multi-page Power BI report designed to analyze sales data across different motorcycle categories (150CC, 180CC, and 250CC). This dashboard provides a specialized view of retail performance, allowing stakeholders to track revenue, volume, and customer preferences within specific engine capacity segments.

**Purpose & Objective**: 
The primary objective of this project was to create a segmented analytical tool that evaluates the performance of different bike classes. By categorizing data into 150CC, 180CC, and 250CC segments, the dashboard enables product managers to identify which engine categories are driving growth and where market demand is shifting.

**Key Insights Delivered**: 
The dashboard delivers deep insights into sales distribution through:
* **Engine Capacity Analysis**: Dedicated reporting pages for 150CC, 180CC, and 250CC categories.
* **Sales Volume & Revenue**: Tracking total units sold and profit margins using interactive KPI cards.
* **Product Comparison**: Utilizing clustered bar and column charts to compare sales across models and regions.
* **Category Share**: Donut charts showing the percentage contribution of different bike variants.

**Tech Stack**: 
* **Power BI Desktop**: Used for the end-to-end development of the report and data visualizations.
* **Power Query**: Facilitated data cleaning, attribute filtering, and transformation of the raw sales dataset.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used to create calculated measures for dynamic KPIs and cross-category comparisons.
* **Interactive Navigation**: Implemented action buttons and advanced slicers for a seamless user experience across different report sections.

**Data Integration & Transformation**: 
The data was processed to handle diverse motorcycle attributes. Using Power Query, the raw data was structured to support specific CC-based segmentation. Key transformations included data type normalization, handling of categorical variables (like CC ratings), and building a robust model to allow for synchronized filtering across various visual types.

**Dashboard Features**: 
* **Segmented Navigation**: Action-button driven navigation between 150CC, 180CC, and 250CC insights.
* **Visual KPIs**: Cards highlighting essential metrics for immediate performance assessment.
* **Advanced Filtering**: Integrated text and category slicers to drill down into specific bike models or time periods.
* **Modern UI/UX**: A clean, professional layout featuring custom icons and high-contrast visuals for better readability.

**Business & Learning Impact**: 
This project demonstrates the ability to build specialized business intelligence reports tailored to product-specific segments. It highlights proficiency in multi-page report design, advanced slicer implementation, and data storytelling. The project showcases how technical Power BI skills can be applied to solve real-world retail and inventory challenges in the automotive/motorcycle industry.
